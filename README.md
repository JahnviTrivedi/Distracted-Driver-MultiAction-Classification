## Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning system that can detect and classify different distracted states of car drivers. The main approach is to apply deep Convolution Neural Network (CNN).using kaggle GPU to run the architecture.
We need to create our own train/validation set.

## Data:

Data is a collection of 10 different states of drivers containing one safe driving and 9 other distracted modes. The dataset can be

Data exploration and preprocessing will be described in subsequent sections.

## Tools:

The project utilizes the following dependencies:
Keras, Numpy, Scipy
